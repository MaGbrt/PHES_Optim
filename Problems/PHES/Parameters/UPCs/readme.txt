UPCs contains the unit performance curves (UPCs) under the form of an array of the size 51x1001 with all the NaN values.
There are 50 levels of head going from 0.5*head_max to 1*head_max and 1001 levels of power going from zero to P_rated.
The filename suffix "_HNL" indicates the UPCs which are more non-linear (they have been transformed using the python script "ModifyCurves.py")
